# Logistic-Regression-Model-

Utilized logistic regression to develop a Machine Learning model that enables rapid and precise patient risk assessment, particularly significant in the resource-limited COVID-19 era. Worked under the guidance of a Project Leader, performed exploratory data analysis, executed feature selection, and formulated a statistical model for predicting mortality risk. Proficient in R, generated code accompanied by visualizations such as histograms and box plots, acquiring valuable skills applicable to Data Science professionals.
